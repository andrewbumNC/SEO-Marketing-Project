# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor 

## Project Name: SEO MARKETING PROJECT

For this project our agency was contracted to clean up the code done by our customers (marketing agency) former website developer. The formatting and functionality of the website are fine, but lacks accessbility for consumers with disabilities. They believe this is also having a negative impact on their SEO scoring impacting their bottom line. In short we are tasked with refactoring their site to improve it's accessbility and SEO score. 

The problem we are solving: 

Low accessbility due to poor semantics, order, and missing alt tags. Little if any commenting. 

Imapct: 

Adding alt tags on images, tweaking semantics, and commenting on all of the changes made so our customer can review the work themselves. 



Guidelines and Instructions from our customer below: 


## User Story from customer 

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria for customer

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
